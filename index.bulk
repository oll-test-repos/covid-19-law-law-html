{"body": "ORDINANCE NO. 6482 AN UNCODIFIED (URGENCY) ORDINANCE OF THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF ANAHEIM IMPOSING A TEMPORARY MORATORIUM ON THE EVICTION OF RESIDENTIAL OR COMMERCIAL TENANTS UNABLE TO PAY RENT BECAUSE OF COVID-19, DECLARING THE ORDINANCE TO BE AN EMERGENCY MEASURE TO TAKE EFFECT IMMEDIATELY UPON ADOPTION, AND PROVIDING DIRECTION TO THE CITY MANAGER REGARDING OTHER POSSIBLE ASSISTANCE TO ANAHEIM RESIDENTS AND BUSINESSES The City Council of the City of Anaheim finds and declares as follows: SECTION 1. Findings. A. On March 4, 2020, the Governor declared a State of Emergency in California due to the threat of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (\"COVID-19\"). On March 17, 2020, the Orange County Public Health Officer declared a public health emergency in Orange County due to COVID-19, which was updated on March 18, 2020. Due to directives from federal, state, and local health officials, residents have been advised to avoid public gatherings and stay at home to prevent the spread of this disease B. On March 16, 2020, the Governor issued Executive Order N-28-20. The Order suspends any state law that would preempt or otherwise restrict the City's exercise of its police power to impose substantive limitations on residential or commercial evictions based on nonpayment of rent resulting from the impacts of COVID-19. C. The City of Anaheim has been impacted by the health crisis of this global pandemic. Sporting events, concerts, plays, and conferences have been cancelled. School closures have occurred and may continue. Employees have been advised to work at home. As a result, restaurant and retail business has significantly declined and workers have been impacted by lost wages and layoffs. Parents have had to miss work to care for home-bound school-age children. As the virus spreads, workers may have to stay home and businesses may have to restrict their activities or close for extended periods. D. Many residential and commercial tenants have experienced sudden income or revenue loss, and further income impacts are anticipated. The loss of income and revenue caused by the effects of COVID-19 may impact tenants' ability to pay rent when due, leaving tenants vulnerable to eviction. E. Providing tenants with a short-term protection from eviction due to the inability to pay rent will help avoid increasing the homeless population and stabilize the rental housing and commercial real estate market by reducing displacement. F. During this state of emergency, and in the interests of protecting the public health and preventing transmission of COVID-19, it is essential to avoid unnecessary displacement of tenants. Prohibiting residential and commercial evictions on a temporary basis is necessary until the spread of the virus can be minimized and the emergency restrictions lifted. G. Nothing in this ordinance waives a tenant's obligation to pay back rent owed once this ordinance is no longer effective, under the terms set forth in Section 5, below. H. The protections afforded to tenants in this Ordinance are intended to apply to sub- tenants as well. SECTION 2. Moratorium on residential evictions due to nonpayment of rent during the COVID-19 emergency. A. This Section 2 will remain in effect until May 31, 2020, unless extended by the City Council. B. No landlord shall initiate proceedings or otherwise take steps to evict a tenant for nonpayment of rent from any residential dwelling (including single family and multi- family homes, mobile homes or other structures lawfully used as a residential dwelling) if the tenant, in accordance with this subsection D, demonstrates that the inability to pay rent is due to COVID-19, the state of emergency regarding COVID-19, or following government-recommended COVID-19 precautions. C. As used in this Section 2, \"covered reason for delayed payment\" means a tenant's loss of income due to any of the following: (i) the tenant was/is sick with COVID- 19 or caring for a household or family member who was/is sick with COVID-19; (ii) the tenant experienced a lay-off, loss of hours, or other income reduction resulting from COVID-19 or the state of emergency; (iii) the tenant's compliance with a recommendation from a government agency to stay home, self-quarantine, or avoid congregating with others during the state of emergency; or (iv) the tenant's need to miss work to care for a home-bound school-age child. D. To take advantage of the protections afforded under this ordinance, a tenant must do all the following: ii. Notify the landlord in writing before the day rent is due that the tenant has a covered reason for delayed payment; ii. Provide the landlord with verifiable documentation to support the assertion of a covered reason for delayed payment; and iii. Pay the portion of rent that the tenant is able to pay. 2 E. If a tenant complies with the requirements of this ordinance, a landlord shall not serve a notice pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure sections 1161 and 1162, file or prosecute an unlawful detainer action based on a three-day pay or quit notice, or otherwise take steps to evict the tenant for nonpayment of rent. F. Nothing in this ordinance relieves the tenant of liability for the unpaid rent after expiration of this ordinance. SECTION 3. Moratorium on commercial evictions due to nonpayment of rent during the COVID-19 emergency. A. This Section 3 remains in effect until May 31, 2020, unless extended by the City Council. B. No landlord shall initiate proceedings or otherwise take steps to evict a commercial tenant (a business, a non-profit, or commercial enterprise renting or leasing a structure used for business purposes) for nonpayment of rent if the tenant, in accordance with this subsection D, demonstrates that the inability to pay rent is due to COVID-19, the state of emergency regarding COVID-19, or following government-recommended COVID-19 precautions. C. As used in this Section 3, \"covered reason for delayed payment\" means a tenant's loss of business income due to any of the following: (i) the owner, management personnel, or key employees of the business were/are sick with COVID-19 or caring for household or family members who were/are sick with COVID-19; (ii) the business experienced income reduction resulting from COVID-19 or the state of emergency; (iii) the business's compliance with a recommendation from a government agency to close, reduce service, or limit contact between members of the public and its personnel/employees; or (iv) key employee(s) of the business need to miss work to care for a home-bound school-age child. D. To take advantage of the protections afforded under this ordinance, a tenant must do all the following: i. Notify the landlord in writing before the day rent is due that the tenant has a covered reason for delayed payment; ii. Provide the landlord with verifiable documentation to support the assertion of a covered reason for delayed payment; and iii. Pay the portion of rent that the tenant is able to pay. E. If a tenant complies with the requirements of this ordinance, a landlord shall not serve a notice pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure sections 1161 and 1162, file or prosecute an unlawful detainer action based on a three-day pay or quit notice, or otherwise take steps to evict the tenant for nonpayment of rent. 3 F. Nothing in this ordinance relieves the tenant of liability for the unpaid rent after expiration of this ordinance. SECTION 4. Effective Date. This ordinance takes effect immediately upon enactment. SECTION 5. One-Hundred-Twenty-Day Payback Period. A. A tenant afforded eviction protection under Sections 2 or 3 of this ordinance shall have up to one hundred and twenty (120) days after the expiration of this ordinance to pay its landlord unpaid rent. The terms of the repayment plan are to be agreed upon between the landlord and tenant, provided that, if no agreement is reached between the landlord and tenant, the back/past rent due shall be repaid in four (4) equal installments to be paid in monthly intervals beginning thirty (30) days after the date the rent becomes due pursuant to the terms of this ordinance. No late fees, costs or other penalties shall be assessed or due from the tenant based on the delay in paying rent as provided for in this ordinance. During this 120-day period, the protections against eviction set forth in Sections 2 and 3 of this ordinance shall apply to such tenants. B. The date upon which a delayed payment comes due for the purposes of Code of Civil Procedure Section 1161(2) shall be the date agreed upon by the landlord and tenant in a repayment plan, or, if no agreement is reached as specified in subsection (A) above. SECTION 6. Additional Direction by the City Council. A. The City Council directs the City Manager to develop and disseminate materials explaining the provisions of this ordinance to residential and commercial tenants and landlords in Anaheim. B. The City Council finds that the impact of non-payment of rent could have severe consequences on rental property owners, which harm could be mitigated by federal housing assistance and funding. The Council accordingly directs the City Manager, at the earliest possible opportunity, to request that the federal government include an increase in federal housing funding to support tenants and landlords negatively impacted by the COVID-19 crisis and reimburse cities who assist tenants and landlords. C. The City Council finds that the recently adopted Senior Safety Net Program, which utilizes state and federal housing funds to assist Anaheim Senior Citizens with housing costs, could be expanded to include all Anaheim residents impacted by the COVID-19 crisis, and directs the City Manager to report to the City Council at the earliest possible date the viability of expanding this program to all residents impacted by the COVID-19 crisis. D. The City Council acknowledges the Governor's Executive Order N-33-20, also known as the \"Stay at Home Except for Essential Needs\" order. The City Council directs the City Manager to report back to the City Council at the earliest possible date a local implementation plan for this order to the extent local flexibility is allowed. E. The City Council acknowledges the severe economic impact of the COVID-19 crisis and related government actions, and directs the City Manager to work with affected stakeholders and report back to the City Council at the earliest possible date a package of economic assistance and recovery recommendations for the Council to consider to have Anaheim prepared for economic recovery. SECTION 7. Emergency Declaration. The City Council declares this ordinance to be an emergency measure, to take effect immediately upon adoption by a four-fifths vote pursuant to Anaheim City Charter section 511. The facts constituting the emergency are as follows: The directives from health officials to contain the spread of COVID-19 have resulted in loss of business, furloughs, lost wages, and lack of work for employees. To protect the public health, safety, and welfare, the City must act, on an emergency basis, to temporarily prohibit the eviction of residential and commercial tenants who are unable to pay rent due to income losses caused by the effects of COVID-19. SECTION 8. The City Clerk shall certify to the passage of this Ordinance and shall cause this Ordinance or a summary thereof to be printed once within fifteen (15) days after its adoption in the Anaheim Bulletin, a newspaper of general circulation, published and circulated in the City of Anaheim. THE FOREGOING ORDINANCE was introduced at a regular meeting of the City Council of the City of Anaheim held on the 24th day of March, 2020, and passed and adopted as an urgency measure on that date, by the following vote, and shall be and become effective immediately: AYES: Mayor Sidhu and Council Members Faessel, Barnes, Brandman, Moreno, Kring, and O'Neil NOES: None ABSENT:None ABSTAIN: None By: ATTEST: CITY CLERK OF THE CITY OF ANAHEIM CLERK'S CERTIFICATE STATE OF CALIFORNIA COUNTY OF ORANGE CITY OF ANAHEIM ) ss I, THERESA BASS, City Clerk of the City of Anaheim, do hereby certify that the foregoing is the original Ordinance No. 6482 introduced at a regular meeting of the City Council of the City of Anaheim held on the 24th day of March, 2020, and passed and adopted as an urgency measure on that date, by the following vote of the members thereof: AYES: Mayor Sidhu and Council Members Faessel, Barnes, Brandman, Moreno, Kring, and O'Neil NOES: None ABSENT: None ABSTAIN: None IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this 24th of March, 2020.

(a) The city hereby finds that during a state of emergency or local emergency, including, but not limited to, an earthquake, flood, fire, riot, storm, drought, plant or animal infestation, disease, or other natural or manmade disaster, some merchants have taken unfair advantage of consumers by greatly increasing prices for essential consumer goods and services. While the pricing of consumer goods and services is generally best left to the marketplace under ordinary conditions, when a declared state of emergency or local emergency results in abnormal disruptions of the market, the public interest requires that excessive and unjustified increases in the prices of essential consumer goods and services be prohibited. It is the intent of the city in enacting this act to protect residents from excessive and unjustified increases in the prices charged during or shortly after a declared state of emergency or local emergency for goods and services that are vital and necessary for the health, safety, and welfare of consumers. Further, it is the intent of the city that this section be liberally construed so that its beneficial purposes may be served.

However, a greater price increase is not unlawful if that person can prove that the increase in price was directly attributable to additional costs imposed on it by the supplier of the goods, or directly attributable to additional costs for labor or materials used to provide the services, during the state of emergency or local emergency, and the price is no more than 10 percent greater than the total of the cost to the seller plus the markup customarily applied by the seller for that good or service in the usual course of business immediately prior to the onset of the state of emergency or local emergency. (c) The prohibitions of this section may be extended for additional 30-day periods, as needed, by the Council, if deemed necessary to protect the lives, property, or welfare of the residents. (d) A violation of this section is a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment in a county jail for a period not exceeding one year, or by a 2 of 5 CITY OF FRESH fine of not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000), or by both that fine and imprisonment. Alternatively, an administrative citation may be imposed pursuant to Section 1-308 of this code with an administrative fine of up to $10,000 per violation. (e) A violation of this section shall constitute an unlawful business practice and an act of unfair competition within the meaning of Section 17200 of the Business and Professions Code.

Post a sign in a conspicuous place at all public entries to the venue that instructs members of the public to not attend if they are experiencing symptoms of respiratory illness, including fever or cough. d. Adhere to communicable disease control recommendations provided by the CDC, including guidance for cleaning and disinfecting the site. See guidance posted at https:/www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/organizations/businesses- employers.html. 3. Effective immediately, and in accordance with Governor Newsom's COVID-19 Guidance on March 15, 2020, all permanent food facilities, as defined by Health and Safety Code $ 113849, may only prepare and offer food that is provided to customers via delivery service, via pick-up for takeout dining, and via drive-thru. Bars, pubs, cocktail lounges, night clubs, wineries, breweries, and distilleries that offer food to consumers may remain open only for purposes of continuing to prepare and offer food to consumers via delivery service, via pick-up, or drive-thru. Wineries, breweries, or distilleries licensed by Alcoholic Beverage Control to sell alcohol for consumption off the licensed premises may also remain open for purposes of selling bottled or packaged alcohol via delivery service or via pick-up only. Permanent food facilities that provide and offer food to consumers for pick up must require patrons or groups of patrons who are ordering food and beverages to be and remain at least six (6) feet apart from each other while inside the facility. 4. Further, the Health Officer orders the immediate closure of the following types of businesses: a. Bars, pubs, cocktail lounges, or nightclubs that do not serve food; March 16, 2020 Page 3 b. Wineries, breweries, distilleries, and tap rooms that do not serve food or are not licensed to sell bottled or packaged alcohol off the licensed premises; c. Gyms and fitness centers; and d. Movie theaters, live performance theaters, bowling alleys, and arcades. 5. This Order is based upon scientific evidence and best practices, as currently known and available, to protect members of the public from avoidable risk of serious illness and death resulting from the spread of COVID-19, as well as to protect the healthcare system from a surge of cases into its emergency rooms and hospitals. The Order supports the California Department of Public Health and the CDC's efforts to institute necessary social distancing measures to reduce community transmission of COVID-19. 6. Existing community transmission of COVID-19 in the City presents a substantial and significant risk of harm to the health of residents. Currently, there is no vaccine available to protect against and no specific treatment for COVID-19. As of March 16, 2020, there have been at least 5 cases of COVID-19 reported in City. 7. The virus that causes COVID-19 can be spread easily through person-to-person contact. This risk of transmission is increased when people are in close proximity. All group events and gatherings pose an increased risk for transmission of COVID-19 and thus, are a substantial risk to public health. Circumstances associated with Group Events and Mass Gatherings, smaller events and gatherings, and the public's presence in businesses where it is usual for patrons to have extended close contact, that are likely to exacerbate the spread of COVID-19 include, without limitation: (a) the increased likelihood that these events, gatherings, and businesses will attract people from a geographic area with known COVID-19 community transmission, (b) the prolonged time period during which large numbers of people are in close proximity, (c) the difficulty in tracing and controlling additional exposures when arge numbers of people attend a single event, and (d) the inability to ensure both that attendees are not infected with COVID-19 and will follow adequate hygienic and social distancing practices. B. In the absence of a specific immunization or treatment for COVID-19, social distancing is the only and most readily available tool to prevent this disease. Increasing social distancing and limiting gatherings are proven ways to slow transmission of communicable diseases. Accordingly, to reduce the community transmission of COVID-19, the Health Officer has ordered the temporary prohibition of all Group Events and Mass Gatherings, as defined in Section 9, and is also requiring the closure of certain businesses where it is usual practice for patrons to remain in close proximity. 9. Definitions: a. For purposes of this Order, Group Events and Mass Gatherings are any gathering, assembly, event, or convening that brings together or is likely to bring together 50 or more persons at the same time in an indoor or outdoor confined or enclosed space, for any purpose including a business, cultural, religious, athletic, entertainment, social, or other special event. These types of Group Events and Mass Gatherings are likely to result in situations where people will be within six (6) feet of each other for an extended period of time (greater than 10 minutes). b. Group Events and Mass Gatherings include, without limitation: (a) any convention, arena, or meeting space with fixed seating or other set-up where seating is placed adjacent to each other in rows; (b) any space where event attendees stand in close proximity to each other, such as a concert or other performance that includes \"standing room only\" sections; (c) an March 16, 2020 Page 4 admission or concession line/queue; and (d) a confined or closed outdoor space: (i) that is enclosed by a fence, physical barrier, or other structure and (ii) where people are within six (6) feet of one another for more than ten (10) minutes. Specific examples include, but are not limited to, conventions, conferences, training activities, concerts, and athletic events. 10. This Order is intended to deter the spread of COVID-19 by preventing people from being in unnecessary close contact. Certain activities are essential to the functioning of the City and the well- being of our residents and must continue. Accordingly, the requirements in this Order do not apply to the following sites or situations where residents must obtain or participate in essential governmental, educational, or other essential services (those that meet basic human needs): (a) attendance at regular school classes, work, or essential governmental services; (b) places where people are in transit or waiting for transit including the Long Beach Airport or bus or train stations or terminals; (c) grocery stores and retail stores; (d) congregate living situations, including dormitories; (e) hospitals and healthcare facilities. 11. This Order does not prohibit use of enclosed spaces where 50 or more people may be present at different times during the day, as long as 50 or more people are not present in the space at the same time 12. This Order does not apply to the following: i. Cafeterias, commissaries, and retail food facilities located within hospitals, nursing homes, governmental buildings that provide essential services to the public, or within other licensed health care facilities. ii. Grocery stores, farmers markets, and pharmacies. Charitable or governmental organization providing meals to the indigent population. iv. Concessionaires or food services within the Long Beach Airport. 13. This Order does not, in any way, restrict: (a) first responder access to the site(s) named in this Order during an emergency or (b) local, state or federal officers, investigators, or medical or law enforcement personnel from carrying out their lawful duties at the site(s) named in this Order. 14. The entities subject to this Order that are not required to close may otherwise remain open for business and perform essential functions and operations during the duration of this Order. 15. The City shall promptly provide copies of this Order by: (a) posting it on the Long Beach's Department of Health and Human Services website (http://www.longbeach.gov/health/), (b) posting it at the Civic Center located at 411 W. Ocean Blvd., Long Beach, CA 90802, (c) providing it to any member of the public requesting a copy, (d) issuing a press release to publicize the Order throughout the City, and (e) by serving via email on large facilities known to the Health Officer that are likely to be subject to this Order (but service via email is not required for compliance). 16. The owner, manager, or operator of any facility that is likely to be impacted by this Order is strongly encouraged to post a copy of this Order onsite and to provide a copy to any member of the public requesting a copy. 17. Because guidance may change, the owner, manager, or operator of any facility that is subject to this Order is ordered to consult the Long Beach Department of Health and Human Services website (http://www.longbeach.gov/health/) daily to identify any modifications to the Order and is required to comply with any updates until the Order is terminated. March 16, 2020 Page 5 18.

This Order is issued in accordance with, and incorporates by reference, the March 4, 2020 Proclamation of a State of Emergency issued by Governor Gavin Newsom and the and the March 4, 2020 declarations of a local and public health emergency issued by the City Council of Long Beach, the Proclamation of Local Emergency by the City Manager, and the Declaration of Local Health Emergency by the Health Officer, respectively, and as they may be supplemented. To protect the public's health, the Health Officer may take additional action(s) for failure to comply with this Order. Violation of this Order is a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment, fine or both under California Health and Section Code Section 120275 et seq. Further, pursuant to California Government Code Section 41601, the Health Officer requests that the Long Beach Chief of Police ensure compliance with and enforcement of this Order. 20. This Order shall be effective until 11:59 p.m. on March 31, 2020, or until it is earlier rescinded, superseded, or amended by the Health Officer or State Public Health Officer, in writing.

{"body": "CITY OF LONGBEACH Health and Human Services 2525 Grand Avenue, Long Beach, CA 90815 (562) 570-4000 FAX (562) 570-4049 ORDER OF THE HEALTH OFFICER DATE ORDER ISSUED: March 12, 2020 Summary: The virus that causes Coronavirus 2019 Disease is easily transmitted, especially in group settings, and it is essential that the spread of the virus be slowed to protect the ability of public and private health care providers to handle the influx of new patients and safeguard public health and safety. Because of the risk of the rapid spread of the virus, and the need to protect the most vulnerable members of the community, this Order prohibits all public and private indoor and outdoor gatherings within an enclosed space of 250 persons in the City of Long Beach beginning at 12 a.m. on March 13, 2020 and continuing until April 30, 2020, subject to the limited exceptions and under the terms and conditions more particularly set forth below. For all other gatherings, the Health Officer strongly recommends following the social distancing protocols attached to this Order, including canceling, rescheduling, or not attending events that do not allow social distancing of 6 feet per person. Organizations that serve high-risk populations should cancel gatherings of more than 10 people. UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE SECTIONS 101040, 101085, AND 120175, THE HEALTH OFFICER OF THE CITY of LONG BEACH ORDERS: 1. Effective as of 12:00 a.m. on Friday, March 13, 2020, and continuing until 11:59 p.m. on April 30, 2020, public or private Mass Gatherings (as defined in Section 8 below) are prohibited in the City of Long Beach (the \"City\"). 2. In addition, the Health Officer strongly recommends that all persons within the City follow the social distancing outlined in the \"Implementation of Mitigation Strategies for Communities with Local COVID-19 Transmission\" issued by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (\"CDC\") on or around March 11, 2020 (available online at www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/community-mitigation-strategy.pdf). The Health Officer urges people to (i) not attend non-essential gatherings during the duration of this Order in order to help slow down the spread of the COVID-19 virus; (ii) postpone or cancel smaller gatherings that do not allow for social distancing of 6 feet per person; and (iii) cancel gatherings of more than 10 people if the organization serves high-risk populations, and (iv) large non-essential entertainment or social gatherings should be postponed or canceled. 3. This Order is issued based on evidence of increasing occurrence of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (\"COVID-19\") within the City and surrounding communities, scientific evidence and best practices regarding the most effective approaches to slow the transmission of communicable diseases generally and COVID-19 specifically, and evidence that the age, condition, and health of a significant portion of the population of the City places them at risk for serious health complications, including death, from COVID-19. The scientific evidence shows that at this stage of the emergency, it is essential to slow virus transmission as much as possible to protect the most vulnerable and to prevent the health care system from being overwhelmed. ORDER OF THE HEALTH OFFICER DATE ORDER ISSUED: March 12, 2020 Page |2 4. This Order will reduce the likelihood that many individuals will be exposed to COVID-19 at a single event and will thereby slow the spread of COVID-19 in our community. By reducing the spread of COVID-19, this Order will help preserve critical and limited healthcare capacity in the City. 5. This Order is issued to prevent circumstances often present in Mass Gatherings that are likely to exacerbate the spread of COVID-19. Those circumstances include, without limitation: (a) the increased likelihood that Mass Gatherings will attract people from a broad geographic area; (b) the prolonged time period during which large numbers of people are in close proximity; (c) the difficulty in tracing exposure when large numbers of people attend a single event; and (d) the inability to ensure that attendees follow adequate hygienic and social distancing practices like those described in the attached Social Distancing Recommendations. 6. This Order is issued in accordance with, and incorporates by reference, the March 4, 2020 Proclamation of a State of Emergency and the March 12, 2020 Executive Order N-25-20 issued by Governor Gavin Newsom, the March 4, 2020 Proclamation by the Acting City Manager Declaring the Existence of a Local Emergency issued by Tom Modica, and the March 4, 2020 Declaration of Local Health Emergency Regarding Novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) issued by the Health Officer. 7. The Health Officer will continue to assess the quickly evolving situation and may, at any time or from time to time, modify or extend this Order, or issue additional orders, related to COVID-19. 8. Definitions: a. For purposes of this Order, a \"Mass Gathering\" is any event or convening, subject to the exceptions and clarifications below, that brings together or is likely to bring together 250 or more persons at the same time in a single room or other single confined or indoor space, such as, by way of example and without limitation, an auditorium, theatre, stadium (indoor or outdoor), arena or event center, meeting hall, conference center, or any other confined indoor or confined outdoor space. b. A \"Mass Gathering\" includes events in confined outdoor spaces, which means an outdoor space that (i) is enclosed by a fence, physical barrier, or other structure and (ii) where people are present, and they are within arm's length of one another for extended periods. c. This Order also does not prohibit gatherings of people in multiple, separate enclosed spaces in a single building such as a multiplex movie theater, so long as 250 people are not present in any single space as the same time. This Order also does not prohibit use of enclosed spaces where 250 or more people may be present at different times during the day, so long as 250 or more people are not present in the space at the same time. For any gathering covered by this subsection c., the Health Officer strongly encourages compliance with the attached Social Distancing Recommendations, including providing hand sanitizer and tissues and increasing cleaning of commonly touched surfaces. ORDER OF THE HEALTH OFFICER DATE ORDER ISSUED: March 12, 2020 Page |3 d. For purposes of clarity, a \"Mass Gathering\" does not include the following: (i) Long Beach Airport, (ii) public or private schools; (ili) museums (so long as visitors are generally are not within arm's length of one another for extended periods); (iv) spaces where 250 or more persons may be in transit or waiting for transit such as bus, ferry, or subway stations or terminals (or shopping areas associated with the buildings housing those stations or terminals); (v) office space, hotels, or residential buildings; (vi) grocery stores, shopping malls, or other retail establishments where large numbers of people are present but it is unusual for them to be within arm's length of one another for extended periods; and (vii) hospitals and medical facilities. In all such settings, the Health Officer recommends following the attached Social Distancing Recommendations, and harm reduction measures such as hand sanitizer and tissues should be provided when possible. However, except for spaces covered by clause (iv) above, any specific large gathering space that is part of any building included in this subparagraph d. is subject to the prohibition on Mass Gatherings if the space holds 250 or more people. A \"Mass Gathering\" also includes events held in a cruise ship while that ship is docked at any City port. 9. This Order shall be effective until 12:00 p.m. on April 30, 2020, or until it is earlier rescinded, superseded, or amended by the Health Officer or by the State Public Health Officer, in writing.

Violation of or failure to comply with this Order is a crime punishable by fine, imprisonment, or both. (California Health and Safety Code $ 120295; County Ordinances 533 and 556.) UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE SECTIONS 101040, 101085, AND 120175, TITLE 17 CALIFORNIA CODE OF REGULATIONS SECTION 2501, AND RIVERSIDE COUNTY CODE SECTION 533.6, THE HEALTH OFFICER OF THE COUNTY OF RIVERSIDE (\"HEALTH OFFICER\") ORDERS: 1. All gatherings within the jurisdiction of the Public Health Officer of the County of Riverside with an expected presence of at least 10 individuals taking place between March 16, 2020 and April 30, 2020 inclusive are hereby prohibited, regardless of venue. If a venue is subdivided into multiple spaces separated by physical walls or sufficient airspace, the limit per subdivision of space is 10. This order supersedes the Order of March 12, 2020 regarding mass gatherings. 2. It is further ordered that even for gatherings below this size, if a minimum social distance of six feet between attendees cannot be maintained in the venue or a subdivision thereof, the gathering is prohibited. 3. This Order does not apply to courts of law, medical providers, public utilities, critical county, city, and special district operations, critical school operations such as nutrition programs, continuity of business operations, logistics/distribution centers, congregate living settings, daycare and childcare, shelters, public transportation, airport travel, or necessary shopping at fuel stations, stores or malls. However, these settings are instructed to observe all applicable state and federal guidelines for infection control. 4. To the extent possible, daycare and childcare facilities must operate under the following mandatory conditions: A. Childcare must be carried out in stable groups of 12 or fewer (\"stable\" means that the same 12 or fewer children are in the same group each day). B. Children shall not change from one group to another. C. If more than one group of children is cared for at one facility, each group shall be in a separate room. Groups shall not mix with each other. D. Childcare providers shall remain solely with one group of children. 5. This Order is issued as a result of the worldwide pandemic of COVID-19 disease, also known as \"novel coronavirus,\" which has infected at least 128,000 individuals worldwide in 116 countries and is implicated in over 4,700 worldwide deaths, including fifteen (15) cases in Riverside County. 6. This Order is issued based on evidence of increasing transmission of COVID-19 both within the County of Riverside and worldwide, scientific evidence regarding the most effective approach to slow transmission of communicable diseases generally and COVID-19 specifically, as well as best practices as currently known and available to protect the public from the risk of spread of or exposure to COVID-19. 7. This Order is intended to reduce the likelihood of exposure to COVID-19, thereby slowing the spread of COVID-19 in communities worldwide. As the presence of individuals increases, the difficulty and magnitude of tracing individuals who may have been exposed to a case rises exponentially, increasing the likelihood that such gatherings will impair efforts at mitigating the spread of the illness. 8. This Order is issued in accordance with, and incorporates by reference, the: March 4, 2020 Proclamation of a State Emergency issued by Governor Gavin Newsom; the March 8, 2020 Declaration of Local Health Emergency based on an imminent and proximate threat to public health from the introduction of novel COVID-19 in Riverside County; the March 10, 2020 Resolution of the Board of Supervisors of the County of Riverside proclaiming the existence of a Local Emergency in the County of Riverside regarding COVID-19; the March 10, 2020 Resolution of the Board of Supervisors of the County of Riverside ratifying and extending the Declaration of Local Health Emergency due to COVID-19; the guidance issued on March 11, 2020 by the California Department of Public Health regarding large gatherings of 250 people or more; and the guidance issued on March 15, 2020 by the Governor of California. . This Order comes after the release of substantial guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the California Department of Public Health, and other public health officials through the United States and around the world recommending the cancellation of gatherings involving more than ten (10) or more persons in a single space at the same time. 10.

{"body": "ORDINANCE NO. 2020-0014 Adopted by the Sacramento City Council March 17, 2020 An Interim Ordinance for One Year Tolling Land Use Entitlements in the City of Sacramento and Declaring the Ordinance to be an Emergency Measure to Take Effect Immediately Upon Adoption BE IT ENACTED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF SACRAMENTO: SECTION 1. Findings. The City Council finds and declares as follows: A. The City of Sacramento is responding to the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a respiratory illness first identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, and now being reported internationally, including in the United States. B. On January 31, 2020, the Federal Health and Human Services Secretary declared a public health emergency to aid the nation's healthcare community in responding to the outbreak of COVID-19 in the United States. C. On March 4, 2020, Governor Gavin Newsom proclaimed a State of Emergency as a result of the threat of COVID-19 in the State of California. D. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization characterized the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic. E. As of March 12, 2020, the Word Health Organization reported a total of 125,048 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 4,613 deaths globally; the Center for Disease Control, reported a total of 1,215 cases and 36 deaths in the United States; the California Department of Public Health reported a total of 198 cases and 4 deaths in the State; and the County of Sacramento reported a total of 17 cases and 1 death in the county. Federal, State and local public health agencies agree that the number of cases of COVID-19 will significantly increase in all regions of the country, including the City of Sacramento. This increasing problem may dramatically impact city staff and the city's ability to provide essential services. F. On March 12, 2020, Governor Gavin Newsom, issued Executive Order N-25-20. The Governor stated, among other things, that despite sustained efforts, COVID-19 remains a threat and further efforts are needed to control the spread of the virus; that local officials may issue guidance limiting or recommending limitations upon attendance at public assemblies, conferences, or other mass events; and that individuals exposed to COVID-19 may be unable Ordinance 2020-0014 March 17, 2020 Page 1 of 3 to work, may experience a loss of income, health care, medical coverage, and the ability to pay for housing and basic needs. The Governor ordered, among other things, that residents are to heed orders of state and local health officials, including social distancing measures; and that provisions of state law relating to disability insurance, unemployment insurance, emergency medical services, taxes, medical facilities, and public meetings, are modified during this emergency. G. On March 13, 2020, the City Council adopted a resolution declaring a local emergency relating to the Covid-19 pandemic. H. These conditions warrant and necessitate measures to mitigate adverse economic effects that may be experienced by businesses and property owners during this emergency. 1. The city council of the City of Sacramento finds and declares that the global health emergency caused by the Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak is delaying the start and completion of construction of land development projects and the land use approvals for these projects are at risk of expiring. Because the processing, approval, and issuance of land use entitlements represent a substantial investment of money, time, and effort toward the successful completion of these projects, expiration of these entitlements represents a significant loss for the owners and the city. The city council desires to protect against this potential loss and preserve development opportunities by granting additional time to the term of these entitlements. SECTION 2. Tolling. Notwithstanding the provisions of Title 17 of the Sacramento City Code, the time to establish a use, construct a development project, or demolish a building or structure under a discretionary permit under section 17.808.400, including any extensions thereof, does not include the period that this ordinance is in effect. This section applies only to those entitlements that are valid and not expired as of the effective date of this ordinance. SECTION 3. Interim Ordinance. This ordinance is enacted by the city council as an interim ordinance, without notice and hearing before the Planning and Design Commission and City Council as otherwise required by Title 17. It is anticipated that the economic conditions that are impacting land development will improve within one year. This ordinance remains in effect for one year, after which time it expires and is of no further force or effect. Ordinance 2020-0014 March 17, 2020 Page 2 of 3 SECTION 4. Emergency Declaration. The city council declares this ordinance to be an emergency measure, to take effect immediately upon its adoption pursuant to Sacramento City Charter section 32(g)(2). The facts constituting the emergency are set forth in Section 1, above. Adopted by the City of Sacramento City Council on March 17, 2020, by the following vote: Ayes: Members Ashby, Carr, Guerra, Hansen, Harris, Jennings, Schenirer, Warren and Mayor Steinberg Noes: None Abstain: None Absent: None Attest: Mindy Cuppy Digitally signed by Mindy Cuppy Date: 2020.03.18 11:32:21 -07'00' Mindy Cuppy, City Clerk The presence of an electronic signature certifies that the foregoing is a true and correct copy as approved by the Sacramento City Council.

{"body": "ORDINANCE NO. 2020-0015 Adopted by the Sacramento City Council March 17, 2020 An Ordinance Relating to a Temporary Moratorium on Evicting Tenants and Declaring the Ordinance to be an Emergency Measure to Take Effect Immediately Upon Adoption BE IT ENACTED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF SACRAMENTO: SECTION 1. Findings. The City Council finds and declares as follows: A. On March 4, 2020, the Governor declared a State of Emergency in California due to the threat of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (\"COVID-19\"). On March 5, 2020, the Sacramento County Public Health Officer declared a public health emergency in Sacramento County due to COVID-19. Due to directives from federal, state, and local health officials, residents have been advised to avoid public gatherings and stay at home to prevent the spread of this disease. B. On March 16, 2020, the Governor issued Executive Order N-28-20. The order suspends any state law that would preempt or otherwise restrict the city's exercise of its police power to impose substantive limitations on evictions based on nonpayment of rent resulting from the impacts of COVID-19. C. The city has been impacted by the health crisis of this global pandemic. Sporting events, concerts, plays, and conferences have been cancelled. School closures have occurred and may continue. Employees have been advised to work at home. As a result, restaurant and retail business has significantly declined and workers have been impacted by lost wages and layoffs. Parents have had to miss work to care for home-bound school-age children. As the virus spreads, workers may have to stay home for extended periods. D. Many tenants have experienced sudden income loss, and further income impacts are anticipated. The loss of wages caused by the effects of COVID-19 may impact tenants' ability to pay rent when due, leaving tenants vulnerable to eviction. E. Providing tenants with a short-term protection from eviction due to the inability to pay rent will help avoid increasing the homeless population and stabilize the rental housing market by reducing displacement. F. During this state of emergency, and in the interests of protecting the public health and preventing transmission of the coronavirus, it is essential to avoid unnecessary displacement of tenants. Prohibiting evictions on a temporary basis is needed until the spread of the virus can be minimized and the emergency restrictions lifted. Ordinance 2020-0015 March 17, 2020 Page 1 of 3 G. Nothing in this ordinance waives a tenant's obligations to pay back rent owed once this ordinance is no longer effective. SECTION 2. Moratorium on evictions due to nonpayment of rent during the COVID-19 emergency. A. This Section 2 remains in effect until the expiration of the Governor's Executive Order N-28-20, including any extensions. B. This ordinance applies to all residential, but not commercial, tenants. C. No landlord shall endeavor to evict a tenant for nonpayment of rent if the tenant, in accordance with Section 2, demonstrates that the inability to pay rent is due to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), the state of emergency regarding COVID-19, or following government-recommended COVID-19 precautions. D. As used in this Section 2, \"covered reason for delayed payment\" means a tenant's loss of income due to any of the following: (a) tenant was sick with COVID-19 or caring for a household or family member who is sick with COVID-19; (b) tenant experienced a lay-off, loss of hours, or other income reduction resulting from COVID-19 or the state of emergency; (c) tenant's compliance with a recommendation from a government agency to stay home, self-quarantine, or avoid congregating with others during the state of emergency; and (d) tenant's need to miss work to care for a home-bound school-age child. E. To take advantage of the protections afforded under this ordinance, a tenant must do all the following: a. Notify the landlord in writing before the day rent is due that the tenant has a covered reason for delayed payment; b. Provide the landlord with verifiable documentation to support the assertion of a covered reason for delayed payment; and c. Pay the portion of rent that the tenant is able to pay. F. If a tenant complies with the requirements of this ordinance, a landlord shall not serve a notice pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure sections 1161 and 1162, file or prosecute an unlawful detainer action based on a three-day pay or quit notice, or otherwise endeavor to evict the tenant for nonpayment of rent. G. Nothing in this ordinance relieves the tenant of liability for the unpaid rent after expiration of this ordinance. Ordinance 2020-0015 March 17, 2020 Page 2 of 3 SECTION 3. Effective Date. This ordinance takes effect immediately upon enactment. SECTION 4. 120-Day Payback Period. Tenants who were afforded eviction protection under Section 2 of this ordinance shall have up to 120 days after the expiration of the Governor's Executive Order N-28-20, including any extensions, to pay their landlord all unpaid rent. During that 120-day period, the protections against eviction found in Section 2 of this ordinance apply for such tenants. SECTION 5. Emergency Declaration. The city council declares this ordinance to be an emergency measure, to take effect immediately upon adoption pursuant to Sacramento City Charter section 32(g)(2). The facts constituting the emergency are as follows: The directives from health officials to contain the spread of COVID-19 has resulted in loss of business, furloughs, loss of wages, and lack of work for employees. To protect the public health, safety, and welfare, the city must act to prevent eviction of tenants who are unable to pay rent due to wage losses caused by the effects of COVID-19. An emergency measure is necessary to protect tenants from eviction for a temporary period.

The Governor ordered, among other things, that residents are to heed orders of state and local health Resolution 2020-0075 March 13, 2020 Page 1 of 4 officials, including social distancing measures; and that provisions of state law relating to disability insurance, unemployment insurance, emergency medical services, taxes, medical facilities, and public meetings, are modified during this emergency. G. Sacramento City Code chapter 2.116 empowers the City Council to proclaim the existence of a local emergency under certain conditions. H. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused, and will continue to cause, conditions of extreme peril to persons within the City of Sacramento that are likely to be beyond the control of services, personnel, equipment, and facilities of the city, requiring the combined forces of other political subdivisions to combat. These conditions warrant and necessitate the proclamation of the existence of a local emergency. BASED ON THE FACTS SET FORTH IN THE BACKGROUND, THE CITY COUNCIL RESOLVES AS FOLLOWS: Section 1. The City Council finds and determines that the background statements A through I are true. Section 2. The City Council declares that a local emergency now exists throughout the City of Sacramento, California and shall continue to exist for 30 days, unless terminated earlier by the City Council. This declaration shall be reviewed as required under Sacramento City Code section 2. 116.060. Section 3. City Manager Howard Chan is the director of emergency services, pursuant to Sacramento City Code section 2.116.050. Section 4.

{"body": "City and County of Department of Public Health San Francisco Order of the Health Officer ORDER OF THE HEALTH OFFICER No. C19-07 ORDER OF THE HEALTH OFFICER OF THE CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO DIRECTING ALL INDIVIDUALS LIVING IN THE COUNTY TO SHELTER AT THEIR PLACE OF RESIDENCE EXCEPT THAT THEY MAY LEAVE TO PROVIDE OR RECEIVE CERTAIN ESSENTIAL SERVICES OR ENGAGE IN CERTAIN ESSENTIAL ACTIVITIES AND WORK FOR ESSENTIAL BUSINESS AND GOVERNMENT SERVICES; EXEMPTING INDIVIDUALS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS FROM THE SHELTER IN PLACE ORDER BUT URGING THEM TO FIND SHELTER AND GOVERNMENT AGENCIES TO PROVIDE IT; DIRECTING ALL BUSINESSES AND GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES TO CEASE NON- ESSENTIAL OPERATIONS AT PHYSICAL LOCATIONS IN THE COUNTY; PROHIBITING ALL NON-ESSENTIAL GATHERINGS OF ANY NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS; AND ORDERING CESSATION OF ALL NON-ESSENTIAL TRAVEL (SHELTER IN PLACE) DATE OF ORDER: March 16, 2020 Please read this Order carefully. Violation of or failure to comply with this Order is a misdemeanor punishable by fine, imprisonment, or both. (California Health and Safety Code $ 120295, et seq.; California Penal Code $$ 69, 148(a)(1); San Francisco Administrative Code section 7.17(b).) Summary: The virus that causes Coronavirus 2019 Disease (\"COVID-19\") is easily transmitted, especially in group settings, and it is essential that the spread of the virus be slowed to protect the ability of public and private health care providers to handle the influx of new patients and safeguard public health and safety. Because of the risk of the rapid spread of the virus, and the need to protect all members of the community and the Bay Area region, especially including our members most vulnerable to the virus and also health care providers, this Order requires all individuals anywhere in San Francisco to shelter in place-that is, stay at home-except for certain essential activities and work to provide essential business and government services or perform essential public infrastructure construction, including housing. This order begins at 12:01 a.m. on March 17, 2020 and will continue for three weeks through April 7, 2020, subject to the limited exceptions and under the terms and conditions more particularly set forth below. Gatherings of individuals outside the home are generally prohibited, with certain exceptions for essential activities or essential travel or to perform work for essential businesses and government agencies or perform essential infrastructure work. Consistent City and County of Department of Public Health San Francisco Order of the Health Officer ORDER OF THE HEALTH OFFICER No. C19-07 with the directive issued by Governor Gavin Newsom on March 15, 2020, all bars and nightclubs are ordered closed. Restaurants and cafes-regardless of their seating capacity-that serve food are ordered closed except solely for takeout and delivery service. Additionally, all gyms and recreation facilities are ordered closed. Homeless individuals are not subject to the shelter in place order but are strongly urged to find shelter and government agencies are urged to take steps needed to provide shelter for those individuals. Under any of the limited circumstances in which individuals are allowed to interact in person outside their residence, the Health Officer orders individuals to abide by the following requirements: (i) maintain at least six feet from other individuals, wash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds as frequently as possible or using hand sanitizer, cover coughs or sneezes, and not shake hands; (ii) for people with medical conditions, regardless of age, that put them at higher risk of serious complications should they get COVID-19, and other than health care workers and other essential providers, avoid leaving their homes to the extent possible; and (iii) for employers in San Francisco that do not provide essential businesses or government services, take all steps necessary for employees to work remotely from home to the extent possible. These requirements build on the California Department of Public Health and United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines issued March 11, 2020, extended as necessary to address the health emergency affecting the Bay Area region. No individual who is sick may go to the workplace or be outside the home except as necessary to seek or receive medical care in accordance with guidance from public health officials. The Health Officer may revise this Order as the situation evolves, and facilities must stay updated by checking the City Administrator's website (sfgsa.org) regularly. This Order revokes and replaces Order Number C19-05b, issued March 13, 2020, and C19-02, issued March 7, 2020. Those orders are no longer in effect as of the effective date and time of this Order. This Order does not revoke Order Numbers C19-01b, C19- 03, C19-04, or C19-06. UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE SECTIONS 101040, 101085, AND 120175, THE HEALTH OFFICER OF THE CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO (\"HEALTH OFFICER\") ORDERS: 1. The intent of this Order is to ensure that the maximum number of people self-isolate in their places of residence to the maximum extent feasible, while enabling essential services to continue, to slow the spread of COVID-19 to the maximum extent possible. When people need to leave their places of residence, whether to obtain or perform vital services, or to otherwise facilitate authorized activities necessary for continuity of social and commercial life, they should at all times reasonably possible comply with Social Distancing Requirements as defined in Section 10 below. All provisions of this Order should be interpreted to effectuate this intent. Failure to 2 City and County of Department of Public Health San Francisco Order of the Health Officer ORDER OF THE HEALTH OFFICER No. C19-07 comply with any of the provisions of this Order constitutes an imminent threat and creates an immediate menace to public health. 2. All individuals currently living within the City and County of San Francisco (the \"County\") are ordered to shelter at their place of residence. To the extent individuals are using shared or outdoor spaces, they must at all times as reasonably possible maintain social distancing of at least six feet from any other person when they are outside their residence. All persons may leave their residences only for Essential Activities, Essential Governmental Functions, or to operate Essential Businesses, all as defined in Section 10. Individuals experiencing homelessness are exempt from this Section, but are strongly urged to obtain shelter, and governmental and other entities are strongly urged to make such shelter available as soon as possible and to the maximum extent practicable (and to use COVID-19 risk mitigation practices in their operation). 3. All businesses with a facility in the County, except Essential Businesses as defined below in Section 10, are required to cease all activities at facilities located within the County except Minimum Basic Operations, as defined in Section 10. For clarity, businesses may also continue operations consisting exclusively of employees or contractors performing activities at their own residences (i.e., working from home). All Essential Businesses are strongly encouraged to remain open. To the greatest extent feasible, Essential Businesses shall comply with Social Distancing Requirements as defined in Section 10 below, including by maintaining six-foot social distancing for both employees and members of the public, including, but not limited to, when any customers are standing in line. 4. All public and private gatherings of any number of people occurring outside a single household or living unit are prohibited, except for the limited purposes as expressly permitted in Section 10. Nothing in this Order prohibits the gathering of members of a household or living unit. 5. All travel, including, but not limited to, travel on foot, bicycle, scooter, motorcycle, automobile, or public transit, except Essential Travel and Essential Activities as defined below in Section 10, is prohibited. People must use public transit only for purposes of performing Essential Activities or to travel to and from work to operate Essential Businesses or maintain Essential Governmental Functions. People riding on public transit must comply with Social Distancing Requirements as defined in Section 10 below, to the greatest extent feasible. This Order allows travel into or out of the County to perform Essential Activities, operate Essential Businesses, or maintain Essential Governmental Functions. 6. This Order is issued based on evidence of increasing occurrence of COVID-19 within the County and throughout the Bay Area, scientific evidence and best practices regarding the most effective approaches to slow the transmission of communicable diseases generally and COVID-19 specifically, and evidence that the 3 City and County of Department of Public Health San Francisco Order of the Health Officer ORDER OF THE HEALTH OFFICER No. C19-07 age, condition, and health of a significant portion of the population of the County places it at risk for serious health complications, including death, from COVID-19. Due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 virus in the general public, which is now a pandemic according to the World Health Organization, there is a public health emergency throughout the County. Making the problem worse, some individuals who contract the COVID-19 virus have no symptoms or have mild symptoms, which means they may not be aware they carry the virus. Because even people without symptoms can transmit the disease, and because evidence shows the disease is easily spread, gatherings can result in preventable transmission of the virus. The scientific evidence shows that at this stage of the emergency, it is essential to slow virus transmission as much as possible to protect the most vulnerable and to prevent the health care system from being overwhelmed. One proven way to slow the transmission is to limit interactions among people to the greatest extent practicable. By reducing the spread of the COVID-19 virus, this Order helps preserve critical and limited healthcare capacity in the County. 7. This Order also is issued in light of the existence of 37 cases of COVID-19 in the County, as well as at least 258 confirmed cases and at least three deaths in neighboring Bay Area counties, as of 10:00 a.m. on Sunday, March 16, 2020, including a significant and increasing number of suspected cases of community transmission and likely further significant increases in transmission. Widespread testing for COVID-19 is not yet available but is expected to increase in the coming days. This Order is necessary to slow the rate of spread and the Health Officer will re-evaluate it as further data becomes available. 8. This Order is issued in accordance with, and incorporates by reference, the March 4, 2020 Proclamation of a State of Emergency issued by Governor Gavin Newsom, the February 25, 2020 Proclamation by the Mayor Declaring the Existence of a Local Emergency issued by Mayor London Breed, as supplemented on March 11, 2020, the March 6, 2020 Declaration of Local Health Emergency Regarding Novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) issued by the Health Officer, and guidance issued by the California Department of Public Health, as each of them have been and may be supplemented. 9. This Order is also issued in accordance with, and incorporates by reference the March 12, 2020 Executive Order (Executive Order N-25-20) issued by Governor Gavin Newsom. Executive Order N-25- 20 expressly orders that \"[alll residents are to heed any orders and guidance of state and local public health officials, including but not limited to the imposition of social distancing measures, to control the spread of COVID-19.\" This Order is also based on statements by Governor Newsom during a press conference on March 15, 2020, indicating the guidance of the State of California that all nightclubs, bars, wineries, and brewpubs close and that persons 65 years old and older isolate at home. 4 City and County of Department of Public Health San Francisco Order of the Health Officer ORDER OF THE HEALTH OFFICER No. C19-07 10.

{"body": "AN EXECUTIVE ORDER OF THE DIRECTOR OF EMERGENCY SERVICES FOR THE CITY OF SANTA ANA, ENACTING AND IMPLEMENTING A MORATORIUM ON FORECLOSURES AND EVICTIONS DUE TO NON- PAYMENT OF RENT BY RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL TENANTS IMPACTED BY THE NOVEL CORONAVIRUS (COVID-19) AND OTHER PROTECTIVE MEASURES DURING A PERIOD OF LOCAL EMERGENCY SECTION 1. Findings. A. International, national, state, and local health and governmental authorities are responding to an outbreak of respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus named \"SARS-CoV-2,\" and the disease it causes has been named \"coronavirus disease 2019,\" abbreviated COVID-19, (\"COVID-19\"). B. On March 4, 2020, the Governor of the State of California declared a state of emergency to make additional resources available, formalize emergency actions already underway across multiple state agencies and departments, and help the state prepare for broader spread of COVID-19. C. On March 13, 2020, the President of the United States of America declared a national emergency and announced that the federal government would make emergency funding available to assist state and local governments in preventing the spread of and addressing the effects of COVID-19. D. The Orange County Board of Supervisors and Department of Public Health declared a local emergency and local public health emergency to aid the regional healthcare and governmental community in responding to COVID-19. E. On March 17, 2020, the City Council proclaimed the existence of a local emergency to ensure the availability of mutual aid and an effective the City's response to the novel coronavirus (\"COVID-19\"). F. On March 16, 2020, the Governor of the State of California issued Executive Order Executive Order N-28-20, authorizing local governments through their police power to impose substantive limitations on residential or commercial evictions for nonpayment of rent for tenants financially impacted by COVID-19 through May 31, 2020. G. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the California Department of Health, and the Orange County Department of Public Health have all issued recommendations including but not limited to social distancing, canceling or postponing group events, working from home, and other precautions to protect public health and prevent transmission of this communicable virus. Other counties throughout the state have issued \"shelter in place\" directives. H. As of the date of this order and in order to prevent further exposure, many businesses have imposed work from home policies; meetings, events and social gatherings are being cancelled as people remain at home; customers are not patronizing restaurants and stores or hiring domestic help or travelling. With more businesses moving towards working from home, less of the workforce will be patronizing restaurants, hotels and other retail establishments that employ hourly workers, which is expected to lead to hourly cutbacks and employee terminations. I. As a result of the public health emergency and the precautions recommended by health authorities, many tenants in Santa Ana have experienced or expect soon to experience sudden and unexpected income loss. J. The Governor of the State of California has stated that individuals exposed to COVID-19 may be temporarily unable to report to work due to illness caused by COVID-19 or quarantines related to COVID-19 and individuals directly affected by COVID-19 may experience potential loss of income, health care and medical coverage, and ability to pay for housing and basic needs, thereby placing increased demands on already strained regional and local health and safety resources, including shelters and food banks. K. Most, if not all, local schools are closed to prevent further spread of COVID-19. These school closures will cause children to have to remain at home, leading to many parents adjusting their work schedules to take time off work, whether paid or unpaid. Hourly wage earners are unlikely to be paid for time off. The inability to work due to school closures will economically strain those families who cannot afford to take off time from work to stay at home. L. The situation is unprecedented and evolving rapidly. Further economic impacts are anticipated, leaving tenants vulnerable to eviction. M. This order is temporary in nature and only intended to promote stability and fairness within the residential and commercial rental market in the City during the COVID- 19 pandemic outbreak, and to prevent avoidable homelessness thereby serving the public peace, health, safety, and public welfare and to enable tenants in the City whose income and ability to work is affected due to COVID-19 to remain in their homes. N. In the interest of public health and safety, as affected by the emergency caused by the spread of COVID-19, it is necessary to exercise authority to adopt this order related to the protection of life and property, to ensure renters can remain in their homes and prevent proliferation of homelessness and further spread of COVID-19. Displacement through eviction creates undue hardship for tenants through additional relocation costs, stress and anxiety, and the threat of homelessness due to the lack of alternative housing, and lack of moving services and supplies as stores and businesses close. During the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, affected tenants who have lost income due to impact on the economy or their employment may be at risk of homelessness if they are evicted for non-payment as they will have little or no income and thus be unable to secure other housing if evicted. O. People experiencing homelessness are especially vulnerable to the spread of COVID-19 due to an inability to practice social distancing and a lack of access to health care. The Governor has ordered the State to take extraordinary measures to secure shelter for homeless populations during this emergency to limit exposure to and spreading of COVID-19. Widespread evictions of tenants vulnerable to eviction due to financial hardship occurring due to COVID-19 would exacerbate the challenge of sheltering the homeless during this emergency, and increase the risk of spread of COVID-19. P. Promoting stability amongst commercial tenancies is also conducive to public health, allowing businesses to follow the advice and directives of public health officials to close, and allowing employees to avoid public contact, during times of a public health crisis without fear of imminent eviction. Q. The City desires to prohibit evictions due to non-payment of rent for residential and commercial tenants where the failure to pay rent results from income loss resulting from the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). R. This order is adopted pursuant to the City's police powers and powers afforded to the city in time of national, state, county and local emergency during an unprecedented health pandemic, such powers being afforded by the State Constitution, the City Charter of the City of Santa Ana and the Santa Ana Municipal Code to protect the peace, health, and safety of the public. This order is necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety of residents living within the City. Under Government Code Section 8634, this order is necessary to provide for the protection of life and property. NOW, THEREFORE, I, Kristine Ridge, the Director of Emergency Services for the City of Santa Ana, do hereby issue the following order to become effective immediately, subject to further clarification by the City Council: IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT: SECTION 2. Temporary Moratorium on Evictions for Non-Payment of Rent by Residential Tenants Impacted by the COVID-19 Crisis. A. During the period of local emergency declared in response to COVID-19, no landlord shall endeavor to evict a tenant for nonpayment of rent if the tenant demonstrates that the tenant is unable to pay rent due to financial impacts related to COVID-19.

III. BASIS FOR THE ORDER This Order is issued based on evidence of increasing occurrence of COVID-19 within the City, as reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the State Department of Health, 8 and guidance from the City's medical advisory experts, scientific evidence and best practices regarding the most effective approaches to slow the transmission of communicable diseases generally and COVID-19 specifically, and evidence that the age, condition, and health of a significant portion of the population of the City places it at risk for serious health complications, including death, from COVID-19. Due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 virus in the general public, which is a pandemic according to the World Health Organization, there is a public health emergency throughout the City. In addition, some individuals who contract the COVID-19 virus have no symptoms or have mild symptoms, which means they may not be aware they carry the virus. Because even people without symptoms can transmit the virus, and because evidence shows that it is easily spread, gatherings can result in preventable transmission of the virus. The scientific evidence shows that at this stage of the emergency, it is essential to slow virus transmission as much as possible to protect the most vulnerable and to prevent the health care system from being overwhelmed. One proven way to slow the transmission is to limit interactions among people to the greatest extent practicable. By reducing the spread of the COVID-19 virus, this Order helps preserve critical and limited healthcare capacity in the City. This Order also is issued in light of the existence of 41 cases of COVID-19 in the City, as well as at least 56 total confirmed cases in the State of Hawai'i, as of March 22, 2020. IV. INTENT The intent of this Order is to ensure that the maximum number of people self-isolate in their places of residence to the maximum extent feasible, while enabling essential services to continue, to slow the spread of COVID-19 to the maximum extent possible. When people need to leave their places of residence, whether to obtain or perform vital services, or to otherwise facilitate authorized activities necessary for continuity of social and commercial life, they should at all times reasonably possible comply with Social Distancing Requirements as defined in Section II. All provisions of this Order should be interpreted to effectuate this intent. V. GENERAL A. Superseding Order. The Office of the Mayor City and County of Honolulu Emergency Order No. 2020-01 (COVID-19 [Novel Coronavirus]) dated March 20, 2020 (\"Order 2020-01\") is hereby rescinded and superseded by this Order.

The Chiefs of the agencies of Louisville Metro are also directed to shift responsibilities and amend duties of our Metro employees, as necessary and appropriate, so as to ensure that city duties and services are continuously delivered to our residents. All actions taken should be in conjunction with and approved by the Louisville Metro Human Resources Department. 3. That the Department of Procurement of Louisville Metro is hereby empowered, pursuant to KRS Chapters 39A and 39B, to procure any goods and services and take other necessary actions to ensure public health and safety for Louisville Metro employees and our citizens.

If, after review, and in accordance with the guidelines issued by the Center for Disease Control 2 and the Department of Public Health and Wellness, it is determined that said permits should be revoked for the health and well-being of our residents, then they shall be revoked immediately. 5. That this Executive Order shall be interpreted, if necessary, to be consistent and in harmony with any and all ORDERS issued by the Governor of the Commonwealth of Kentucky.

Vulnerable populations include people who: o Are 60 years old and older; or o Have certain health conditions such as heart disease, lung disease, diabetes, kidney disease, Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), and weakened immune systems. .. For vulnerable populations, don't go to gatherings (of 10 people or more) unless it is essential. If you can telecommute, you should. Avoid people who are sick. 2) Workplace and Businesses: Minimize Exposure . Suspend nonessential employee travel. . Minimize the number of employees working within arm's length of one another, including minimizing or canceling large in-person meetings and conferences. Urge employees to stay home when they are sick and maximize flexibility in sick leave benefits. Permit sick employees to stay home without providing a doctor's note. Consider use of telecommuting options. 3) Allowable Events . Cancel or postpone all gatherings. . Do not attend any events or gatherings if sick. For events that aren't cancelled, we recommend: o Having hand washing capabilities, hand sanitizers, and tissues available; o Frequently cleaning high-touch surface areas like countertops, doorknobs, and handrails; and o Finding ways to create physical space to minimize close contact as much as possible. 4) Critical Infrastructure Facilities .

An employee that has come in contact with persons exhibiting symptoms associated with COVID-19 or has traveled to an area the World Health Organization or Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) considers a \"Hotspot,\" is expected to follow the initial self- quarantine recommendations. Employers should require employees (either those exhibiting symptoms or all employees) undergo non-invasive temperature readings prior to entering a critical infrastructure facility. Employees refusing to submit to a temperature reading and those with a temperature greater than 99.6 F should be turned away and barred entry into the critical infrastructure facility. Supervisors at critical infrastructure facilities should be authorized to direct employees to return home if the employee is exhibiting symptoms and presenting a threat of infecting other employees at the critical infrastructure facility. Human Resources departments at critical infrastructure facilities are encouraged to create alternate work plans to help employees remain productive while keeping the workforce safe and healthy. 5) Government Buildings Providing Essential Services All nonessential employees should use telecommuting options. . . . Minimize the number of employees working within arm's length of one another. Provide hand washing capabilities, hand sanitizers, and tissues.

Schools should equip all classrooms with hand sanitizers and tissues. Recommend rescheduling or cancelling medium to large events that are not essential, even if the events would otherwise comply with the Order. Explore remote teaching and online options to continue learning. Schools should develop a plan for citywide school closures and families should prepare accordingly. 7) Grocery Stores and Pharmacies .

TEXT OF PROPOSED RULE Defined terms used in these Emergency Rules shall have the meanings assigned to them in City Code Chapter 10-3 or state law. (A) A permit holder or person in charge of a food enterprise shall display \"Help Prevent Disease\" signage provided by Austin Public Health (these graphic files may be found at: http://www.austintexas.gov/article/covid-19-flyers-and-other-resources) in a prominent public location clearly visible to the general public and patrons; (B) A permit holder or person in charge of a food enterprise shall make hand sanitizer with a minimum alcohol content of 60% available to the general public and to patrons; (C) A permit holder or person in charge of a food enterprise shall disinfect and sanitize commonly touched surfaces and nonfood-contact surfaces of equipment of the establishment at least once every hour; and (D) A food enterprise must adopt and implement a policy that provides for the immediate exclusion of food handlers from duties if they develop a fever greater than or equal to 100.4'F during their shift.

In accordance with said Chapter and Declarations, the Mayor and County Judge hereby find and order as follows: 1. The coronavirus that causes COVID-19 is easily transmitted, especially in group settings, and it is essential that the spread of the virus be slowed to protect the ability of public and private health care providers to handle an influx of patients and safeguard public health and safety. At the current time, the shortage of available tests and rapid nationwide spread of COVID-19 in tested areas indicates there is a strong likelihood of currently undetected community transmission of COVID-19 within the City. Due to said transmission, the Governor of the State of Texas and President of the United States declared states of disaster and emergency on March 13, 2020. 2. Because of the risk of the rapid spread of coronavirus, and the need to protect the most vulnerable members of the community, this Declaration prohibits all indoor gatherings and outdoor gatherings within an enclosed space of 50 persons or more anywhere in the City of Corpus Christi and in Nueces County beginning immediately and continuing for 7 days, which is subject to extension pursuant to requirements of state law. Accordingly, all persons are prohibited from organizing, managing, furthering, and attending Mass Gatherings for the next 7 days, which is subject to extension pursuant to requirements of state law. 3. For all other gatherings, it is strongly recommended that social distancing protocols established by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and found within the \"Implementation of Mitigation Strategies for Communities with Local COVID-19 Transmission\" issued by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (\"CDC\") on or around March 11, 2020 (available online at www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019ncov/downloads/community-mitigation- strategy.pdf), including canceling, rescheduling, or not attending events with more than 50 persons. 4.

A \"Mass Gathering\" includes events in confined outdoor spaces, which means an outdoor space that (i) is enclosed by a fence, physical barrier, or other structure and (ii) where people are present and they are within arm's length of one another for extended periods. c. For purposes of clarity, a \"Mass Gathering\" does not include the following: gatherings of people in multiple, separate enclosed spaces in a single building, so long as 50 people are not present in any single space as the same time; use of enclosed spaces where 50 or more people may be present at different times during the day, so long as 50 or more people are not present in the space at the same time; LiVegan\\SHARED\\Admin Projects\\2020\\Second Amended Order regar erings-50 person limit.docx public or private schools; spaces where 50 or more persons may be in transit or waiting for transit such as bus stops; office space, hotels, or residential buildings; grocery stores, shopping malls, outdoor markets, restaurants, or other retail establishments where large numbers of people are present but it is unusual for them to be within arm's length of one another for extended periods; hospitals, medical facilities and shelters; jails and detention centers; and Corpus Christi International Airport.

Office of the City Clerk Page 3 Printed on 3/20/2020 CITY OF SEATTLE Resolution (Res): Res 31938 A RESOLUTION modifying the March 14, 2020 emergency order relating to residential evictions. WHEREAS, on February 29, 2020, Washington Governor Jay Inslee declared a state of emergency in response to new cases of COVID-19, directing state agencies to use all resources necessary to prepare for and respond to the outbreak; and WHEREAS, on March 3, 2020 the Mayor proclaimed a civil emergency related to the spread of COVID-19, authorizing the Mayor to exercise the emergency powers necessary for the protection of the public peace, safety, and welfare; and WHEREAS, on March 5, 2020 the Council adopted Resolution 31937 affirming the civil emergency, modifying orders transmitted by the Mayor related to the emergency, and establishing Council's expectations related to future orders and reporting by the Mayor during the civil emergency; and WHEREAS, on March 11, 2020, Washington Governor Jay Inslee amended his emergency order to prohibit gatherings of 250 people or more for social, spiritual and recreational activities including, but not limited to, community, civic, public, leisure, faith-based, or sporting events; parades; concerts; festivals; conventions; fundraisers; and similar activities; and WHEREAS, on March 12, 2020, Washington Governor Jay Inslee announced that all schools in King, Snohomish, and Pierce Counties will close through April 24, 2020; and WHEREAS, on March 12, 2020, Public Health - Seattle and King County confirmed 270 cases of COVID-19, including 27 deaths, in King County; and SEATTLE CITY COUNCIL Page 1 Printed on 3/16/20 File Number: Res 31938 WHEREAS, in light of COVID-19 spreading person-to-person and particularly between people who are in close contact with one another, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that: those who are mildly ill self-isolate by staying home, avoiding public areas, and avoiding transportation; sensitive populations avoid people who are sick; and everyone practice self-distancing; and WHEREAS, the Washington State Legislature has declared a state policy to help residents who are experiencing a temporary crisis in retaining stable housing to avoid eviction from their homes, as expressed in Laws of 2019, ch. 356, $ 1; and WHEREAS, the September 2018 Seattle Women's Commission and the King County Bar Association's report Losing Home: The Human Cost of Eviction in Seattle (\"Losing Home Report\") found that the most disadvantaged groups face the highest likelihood of eviction; and WHEREAS, the Losing Home report found that most evicted respondents became homeless, with 37.5 percent completely unsheltered, 25.0 percent living in a shelter or transitional housing, and 25.0 percent staying with family or friends. Only 12.5 percent of evicted respondents found another apartment or home to move into; and WHEREAS, a 2018 investigation by the King County Medical Examiner's Office found that over half of 107 presumed homeless deaths investigated occurred outside and attributed approximately 121, or 62 percent, of presumed homeless deaths investigated to non-natural causes (drug overdose, accidents (including hypothermia), suicide, homicide, and undetermined), making it clear that people experiencing homelessness have a much higher risk than the general population of developing exposure-related conditions; and WHEREAS, persons with underlying health conditions are at greater risk of fatality if they catch SEATTLE CITY COUNCIL Page 2 Printed on 3/16/20 File Number: Res 31938 COVID-19, and preventing individuals from becoming higher-risk patients will protect the public health, safety, and welfare of the region; and WHEREAS, the impacts of the emerging public health crisis on the economy, employment, job retention, child care, and businesses may result in: workers being unable to go to work because of illness; the need to care for children home from day care or school or for other family members without paid sick or safe time; and reduced hours due to reduced demand, furlough, or unemployment as businesses struggle during the state of emergency. These risks are compounded especially for workers without paid sick or safe time, those in the \"gig economy,\" and others without protections that help stabilize income. Historically disadvantaged populations are already at greater risk of eviction. Compounding existing risk with the impacts from the COVID-19 emergency may increase the likelihood of exposure, spread, and contraction of the virus; and WHEREAS, in the last two weeks there has been a significant drop in the number of tenants appearing in court for their eviction hearings in King County resulting in default judgments being entered and tenant losing substantial rights to assert defenses or access legal and economic assistance; and WHEREAS, providing a moratorium on evictions for certain causes resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic is necessary as an additional step to protect public health to support stable housing, decrease the likelihood that individuals and families will fall into homelessness, enabling tenants in the City whose income and ability to work is affected due to COVID-19 to remain in their homes; and decrease the likelihood that individuals and families will increase the likelihood of exposure for themselves or others due to an eviction while the COVID-19 emergency exists; and WHEREAS, on March 14, 2020 the Mayor issued a civil emergency order related to residential evictions; and SEATTLE CITY COUNCIL Page 3 Printed on 3/16/20 File Number: Res 31938 WHEREAS, Seattle Municipal Code subsection 10.02.020.B provides that the Seattle City Council can either ratify and confirm, modify, or reject such an order; NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF SEATTLE THAT: Section 1. The Civil Emergency Order relating to residential evictions issued by Mayor Jenny A. Durkan, dated March 14, 2020, attached to this resolution as Exhibit A, is modified, as shown in Exhibit B. Section 2. The Council requests that the Mayor consider issuing additional emergency orders and make expenditures pursuant to the authority assumed in Section 3 of the modified Emergency Proclamation provided in Exhibit B to Resolution 31937, to help workers and businesses impacted by the public health crisis on the economy. Additional orders and expenditures to consider include: A. Increasing funding for programs that provide emergency rental assistance and other financial support to households unable to pay rent due to economic disruptions caused by COVID-19; and B. Issuing orders or taking other actions to provide rent relief, including deferred payment of rent, requiring payment plans, and other strategies to assist small businesses and nonprofit organizations who are unable to pay rent or pay their employees due to economic disruptions caused by COVID-19.

COVID-19 Order Restricting Food and Beverage Sales in the Cities and Villages of Milwaukee, Bayside, Brown Deer, Fox Point, Glendale, River Hills, Shorewood, Whitefish Bay, Cudahy, South Milwaukee, and St. Francis Under the authority of Wis. Stat. $ 252.03, the Public Health Officers from the Health Departments of Milwaukee City, North Shore (Bayside, Brown Deer, Fox Point, Glendale, River Hills, Shorewood and Whitefish Bay), Cudahy, South Milwaukee, and St. Francis, in coordination with their municipal Mayors, Village Presidents, and the Milwaukee County Executive, order the following: A. Effective as of 2:01 a.m. on Tuesday, March 17, 2020, and continuing until further notice, food and beverage service is restricted as defined in section B.I in the cities and villages of Milwaukee, Bayside, Brown Deer, Fox Point, Glendale, River Hills, Shorewood, Whitefish Bay, Cudahy, South Milwaukee, and St. Francis, unless otherwise exempted in section B.2. This order is based on the restrictions in the \"Order Prohibiting Mass Gatherings of 50 or More People\" issued by Governor Evers on March 16, 2020, to meet the needs of the Milwaukee metropolitan area, which is beginning to experience community transmission of COVID-19. B. Food and Beverage Service Restrictions and Exemptions 1. Restrictions: The locations listed below are ordered closed until further notice, unless otherwise exempted in section B.2. i. Liquor, beer and wine sales in Milwaukee County and its municipalities are restricted to carry-out sales and delivery only, to the extent permitted by law. No onsite consumption is permitted. Food and beverage sales are restricted to carry-out and delivery only. No onsite consumption is permitted. 2. Exemptions to issued closures in B. I and guidance for operating facilities: i. Food service in health care facilities. ii. Food service and catering at weddings or funerals. iii. Lines for carry-out must have an environment where patrons and staff maintain social distancing (six feet away from other people) whenever possible. https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/WIGOV/2020/03/16/file attachments/1402207/DHS%20Order620M LS5%20Gatherings9%20of962050%20or%20More.pdf Weddings and funerals are subject to Governor Evers' Order Prohibiting Mass Gatherings of 50 or More People; weddings and funerals may not have more than 50 people in a space, including food service workers. iv . All are urged to continue to wash hands, utilize hand sanitizer and practice proper respiratory etiquette (coughing into elbow, etc.). C. The immediate implementation of this Order is necessary as patrons of bars and restaurants continue to gather in large numbers, in close proximity to each other, in closed spaces, thereby endangering the health of the staff and the patrons. D. The overriding goal of this Order is to minimize in-person interaction which is the primary means of transmission. The gathering of patrons in restaurants and bars increases and encourages talking, touching, and other social interaction in an environment with a multitude of hard surfaces. E. This Order is issued based on evidence of increasing transmission of COVID-19, scientific evidence regarding the most effective approaches to slow the transmission of communicable diseases generally and COVID-19 specifically, and best practices as currently known and available to protect vulnerable members of the public from avoidable risks of serious illness or death resulting from exposure to COVID-19. Although most people who contract COVID-19 do not become seriously ill, people with mild symptoms and asymptomatic people with COVID-19 may place other vulnerable members of the public at significant risk. F. This Order will reduce the likelihood that many people will be exposed to COVID-19 at a single event, and will thereby slow the spread of COVID-19 within Milwaukee County and its nineteen (19) municipalities. By reducing the spread of COVID-19, this Order will help preserve critical and limited healthcare capacity. G. This Order is issued in light of the existence of several cases of COVID-19 within Milwaukee County, as part of a significant and increasing number of assumed cases of community transmission nationwide.3 H. This Order is issued to prevent circumstances often present in mass gatherings that may exacerbate the spread of COVID-19, such as: the increased likelihood that mass gatherings will attract people from broad geographic areas who could be infected; the prolonged time period in which large numbers of people are in close proximity and could be exposed to COVID-19; and the difficulty in tracing exposure when large numbers of people attend a single event.
